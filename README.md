# KMeans-Clustering-Algorithm-for-Shape-Detection
* Read the exemplary color input image inputEx5_1.jpg and set up a three-dimensional RGB feature space (reshape).
* Implement your own k-means clustering approach with random initialization (see lecture notes) to group the color features.
* Select an appropriate number of clusters k, apply the algorithm and visualize the detected groups in feature and image space (e.g. with color coding: colormap).
* Extend the three-dimensional feature space with additional spatial support using the pixel positions (x, y) and test your algorithm on the five-dimensional feature space. Are the results different or significantly better?
